      <h4  className="fullBlack">Why explain?</h4>
      <p className="halfBlack">There is a lot of explanation happening on a daily basis, within a team, between 2 remote workers, between employees within a company. What if these interactions were recorded and kept in order for reference for our future use. Explain helps you to do that with convenience.</p>
      <br/>
    <h4  className="fullBlack">What is explain roadmap?</h4>
    <p className="halfBlack">Explain wants to connect creators/tinkerers/part timers/subject matter experts to users who need help immediately. Of course we want the helpers earn for their time.</p>
     <p className="halfBlack">Example: Imagine you are on stackoverflow, code is there, what if someone really explains it online to you, give you a clear understanding, and the helper is rewarded for his time.</p>   
        <p className="halfBlack">We want to work with creators/tinkerers , help them gain more mileage, invent tools / apps that help them focus on creations, by giving them support systems that value their time and skillset.</p>
